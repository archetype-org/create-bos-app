## Install
`pnpm add -g @archetype-org/create-bos-app`

## Usage
After installing globally, simply run the CLI to kickstart your new BOS app or widget:
```bash
create-bos-app
```

To run locally, make sure you have [bos-workspace](https://github.com/sekaiking/bos-workspace) installed.

Then, run the command:

```bash
bw dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`.
